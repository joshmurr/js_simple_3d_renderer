# JS 3D Renderer

## This is the first part of [THIS REPO](https://github.com/joshmurr/js_3d_engine). I decided at some point in the project to seperate the engine into it's own repository and import that in as a submodule to other projects. But this turned out to be too soon in the process and was annoying for development. This is the original repo of the engine so I'm just keeping it for the commit history and will archive it in due time.
